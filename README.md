## Object-Oriented Programming Project: Development of a Discussion Forum Using C++

### Description

This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project focused on developing a Discussion Forum using C++. The application facilitates user participation in discussions, message posting, and thread management. It is designed to showcase key OOP concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, while providing a practical and interactive forum experience.
